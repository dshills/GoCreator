name: TODO CLI
description: |
  A simple command-line application for managing personal TODO lists.
  Users can add, list, and mark tasks as complete from the terminal.
  All data is persisted to a local file.

# ============================================================================
# REQUIRED SECTION: User Scenarios & Testing
#
# These describe how real users interact with the system.
# Each scenario should be independently testable and include acceptance criteria.
# ============================================================================
scenarios:
  - id: US1-Add-Task
    priority: P1
    title: User adds a new task to their TODO list
    description: |
      A user wants to add a new task to their personal TODO list.
      They run the application with the "add" command and provide a task description.
    given: User is at the command line with the TODO application available
    when: User executes `todo add "Buy groceries"`
    then: |
      - The application confirms the task was added
      - The task appears in the todo list with a unique ID
      - The task is marked as incomplete
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Task is persisted to storage immediately
      - User receives confirmation with the task ID
      - Next list command shows the new task

  - id: US2-List-Tasks
    priority: P1
    title: User views all their tasks
    description: |
      A user wants to see all their tasks with their completion status.
      The application lists all tasks in a readable format.
    given: User has created several tasks
    when: User executes `todo list`
    then: |
      - All tasks are displayed in a numbered list
      - Each task shows its completion status (☐ or ☑)
      - Tasks are listed in the order they were added
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Output is human-readable and well-formatted
      - Empty list shows "No tasks" message
      - List command completes in < 100ms

  - id: US3-Complete-Task
    priority: P1
    title: User marks a task as complete
    description: |
      A user wants to mark a task as done.
      They specify the task ID and the application updates it.
    given: User has tasks in their list
    when: User executes `todo done 1`
    then: |
      - Task with ID 1 is marked as complete
      - Confirmation message is shown
      - Next list command shows the task as complete
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Only one task can be marked at a time
      - Completing an already-complete task is idempotent
      - User gets error message for invalid task IDs

# ============================================================================
# REQUIRED SECTION: Functional Requirements
#
# These describe WHAT the system must do (technology-agnostic).
# Requirements are testable and unambiguous.
# Use FR-NNN format for requirement IDs.
# ============================================================================
requirements:
  - id: FR-001
    description: System MUST accept "add" command with task description text
    category: Core Functionality
    priority: P1

  - id: FR-002
    description: System MUST store tasks persistently in a local file between sessions
    category: Data Persistence
    priority: P1

  - id: FR-003
    description: System MUST display all tasks with ID, description, and completion status
    category: User Interface
    priority: P1

# ============================================================================
# REQUIRED SECTION: Success Criteria
#
# These are measurable outcomes that indicate the system is working correctly.
# They should be technology-agnostic and verifiable.
# ============================================================================
success_criteria:
  - criterion: Users can add a task and see it persist across application restarts
    measurable: "100% of added tasks remain after process restart"
    priority: Critical

  - criterion: All operations complete within acceptable response time
    measurable: "Add/list/done commands complete in < 100ms for < 1000 tasks"
    priority: High

  - criterion: User receives clear feedback for all actions
    measurable: "All commands return success/error message"
    priority: Medium

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Key Entities (Data Model Concepts)
#
# High-level domain concepts (not implementation details like database tables).
# Define only if your system involves significant data structures.
# ============================================================================
entities:
  - name: Task
    description: A single TODO item with a description and completion status
    attributes:
      - attribute: id
        type: unique identifier
        description: Unique identifier for the task

      - attribute: description
        type: text
        description: The task description provided by the user

      - attribute: completed
        type: boolean
        description: Whether the task has been marked as complete

      - attribute: created_at
        type: timestamp
        description: When the task was created

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Non-Functional Requirements
#
# These describe constraints and quality attributes.
# ============================================================================
nonfunctional_requirements:
  - category: Performance
    description: Application startup time should be < 500ms for typical use

  - category: Usability
    description: Commands should follow common CLI conventions (--help, --version)

  - category: Reliability
    description: Data loss is unacceptable; all writes must be durable

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Metadata and Configuration
#
# Project-level settings that might affect generation.
# ============================================================================
